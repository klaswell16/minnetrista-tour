        Bob Ross was a super chill painter with a giant poofy afro and the calmest voice ever. He had a TV show called The Joy of Painting, where he showed people how to paint cool nature scenes like snowy mountains, peaceful lakes, and his favorite—“happy little trees”!

What made Bob awesome wasnt just his art—it was how he made everyone feel like they could be artists too. Hed say stuff like, “There are no mistakes, just happy accidents,” and “Lets give this tree a friend.” He made painting fun, relaxing, and a little bit silly.

Even though Bob passed away in 1995, kids and adults still love his videos today. So grab a brush, smile big, and remember—theres a little artist in you, too!
