      Ball State University was founded in 1918 by the 5 Ball brothers, The same Ball brothers that
      owned the company that makes the Ball mason jars. When they founded it the school was actually
      called The Indiana State Normal School Eastern Division. The Indiana General Assembly
      renamed the school to Ball Teachers College in 1922. The school reached university status
      in 1965 where it got the name we know today, Ball State University.
