        Presented by the Art Alliance for Contemporary Glass, Clearly Indigenous: Native Visions Reimagined in Glass 
        explores how Indigenous artists are pushing past traditional boundaries by blending cultural stories and 
        symbols with the modern medium of glass. This unique exhibition highlights both the innovative ways Native 
        artists are combining traditional influences with new techniques, and also traces the history of how glass 
        art found its place in Indigenous communities. Featuring more than 100 stunning pieces, the show showcases 
        the creativity of contemporary Native American and Indigenous artists from across the Pacific Rim.
