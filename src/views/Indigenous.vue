  Presented by the Art Alliance for Contemporary Glass, Clearly Indigenous: Native Visions
  Reimagined in Glass explores how Indigenous artists are pushing past traditional boundaries by
  blending cultural stories and symbols with the modern medium of glass. This unique exhibition
  highlights both the innovative ways Native artists are combining traditional influences with new
  techniques, and also traces the history of how glass art found its place in Indigenous
  communities. Featuring more than 100 stunning pieces, the show showcases the creativity of
  contemporary Native American and Indigenous artists from across the Pacific Rim.
